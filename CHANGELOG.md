# Changelog

All notable changes to Dialog4D are documented in this file.

Dialog4D follows Semantic Versioning for public releases.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Fixed an Android/FMX teardown crash that could occur when a
  `MessageDialogAsync` result callback closes the same host/main form that owns
  the Dialog4D context.
- Changed the registry form-hook destruction path so `OnFormDestroyed` runs
  synchronously when hook destruction is already executing on the main thread.
- Kept asynchronous registry cleanup only as a defensive fallback for unexpected
  off-main-thread form destruction.
- Removed the teardown window where per-form registry cleanup could remain
  queued while Android application shutdown was already disposing the main form
  and process-wide Dialog4D state.

### Added

- Added optional internal lifecycle trace support in `Dialog4D.pas`, controlled
  by the `DIALOG4D_TRACE` compiler directive and disabled by default.
- Added BasicDemo Section 11 — Lifecycle / regression scenarios.
- Added example 11.1, `Regression: Close Host Form`, based on the reported
  Android teardown scenario.

### Changed

- Updated form-lifecycle comments and runtime history to document the
  owner-destroying cleanup contract, the inline main-thread cleanup path, and
  the queued fallback path.
- Updated the BasicDemo header and section list to include lifecycle regression
  scenarios.
- Kept the regression demo close-confirmation example faithful to the reported
  button pattern: `[mbOk, mbCancel]`, default `mbCancel`, and close on `mrOk`.

### Documentation

- Updated `README.md` for Dialog4D 1.0.2 and documented the host-form close
  scenario as supported behavior.
- Updated `docs/Architecture.md` to describe registry form-hook cleanup,
  owner-destroying state, inline main-thread `OnFormDestroyed`, and optional
  lifecycle tracing.
- Updated `docs/Guide_en.md` and `docs/Guide_pt-BR.md` with a short supported
  scenario showing a result callback closing the host form.

### Tests

- Confirmed the DUnitX suite passes with 65 tests.
- Validated the regression scenario on Android with `logcat`: with trace
  enabled, cleanup runs through `FormHook.Destroy inline OnFormDestroyed`; with
  trace disabled, the process exits cleanly without `Fatal signal`, `SIGABRT`,
  `crash_dump`, or `tombstoned` entries.
- Validated the Windows run with no memory leak.

### Compatibility

- No public API signature changes.
- Existing Dialog4D usage remains compatible.
- Closing the host form from a `MessageDialogAsync` result callback is now an
  explicitly supported lifecycle scenario.
- The internal trace directive is diagnostic-only and remains disabled by
  default.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Corrected `Dialog4D.Await` timeout behavior so smart `MessageDialog` overloads no longer invoke the user callback when the worker wait times out.
- Replaced internal `TThread.Queue` usage with `TThread.ForceQueue` in `Dialog4D.Internal.Queue`, preserving asynchronous dispatch even when work is scheduled from the main thread.
- Moved automatic parent-form resolution to the main-thread execution path, avoiding `Screen.ActiveForm` / `Application.MainForm` fallback access from worker threads.
- Ensured custom-button arrays are copied at request time, preserving request snapshot semantics even if the caller later modifies the original dynamic array.
- Added validation preventing custom buttons from using `mrNone` as a modal result.
- Improved owner-destroying lifecycle handling so close and callback-suppression telemetry are emitted more consistently when the parent form is destroyed.
- Fixed a lifetime edge case where parent-form destruction during the queued final callback path could allow the active request snapshot to be released by two different cleanup paths.
- Prevented stale open-animation completion callbacks in `Dialog4D.Host.FMX` from emitting out-of-order `tkShowDisplayed` telemetry when a close transition interrupts the opening animation.
- Hardened telemetry formatting so quoted text fields are escaped consistently and CR/LF/TAB characters are normalized for single-line log output.
- Corrected demo example 5.1 so queued callbacks log the correct dialog index instead of capturing the mutable loop variable.
- Restored the previous `FMX.DialogService` preferred mode after the demo comparison scenario so the demo does not leave global DialogService state changed.

### Changed

- Moved per-form state destruction outside the registry critical section during form-destruction cleanup, keeping the registry lock scoped to short map/state publication steps.
- Clarified `DialogService4D` positioning as an adapter for common `FMX.DialogService`-style callback code, not as a full behavioral clone of `FMX.DialogService`.
- Clarified Dialog4D positioning as an FMX-rendered dialog layer for scenarios that need theming, per-form queueing, request snapshots, telemetry, or worker-thread integration.
- Clarified that Dialog4D has no third-party dependency, rather than no dependency at all, because it intentionally depends on Delphi/FMX.
- Clarified global configuration guidance: theme, text provider and telemetry configuration should be performed during application initialization or another controlled configuration point.
- Clarified request snapshot behavior for theme, text provider, telemetry sink, callback and button definitions.
- Clarified telemetry callback semantics so callback telemetry is not over-promised as proof that arbitrary downstream application code completed.
- Standardized unit headers with consistent metadata and version history format.
- Consolidated the `IsMainThreadSafe` helper in `Dialog4D.Internal.Queue.pas`, removing duplicate copies from the public facade and the await helper.

### Documentation

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` as the release-history source for the project.
- Updated `README.md` to align wording with Dialog4D 1.0.1 behavior and clarify request snapshots, await timeout semantics, telemetry boundaries, programmatic close, and `DialogService4D` adapter positioning.
- Updated `docs/Architecture.md` to reflect the 1.0.1 lifecycle, callback, owner-destroying, queueing, snapshot, telemetry, and await semantics.
- Updated `docs/Guide_en.md` and `docs/Guide_pt-BR.md` to use a scope-oriented explanation and align both language versions with the same conceptual structure.
- Adjusted documentation wording around `FMX.DialogService` to present Dialog4D as a complementary FMX-rendered dialog layer for specific coordination needs.
- Updated demo documentation and comments to clarify example 5.1 queue callback behavior and example 9.1 `FMX.DialogService` preferred-mode restoration.

### Tests

- Expanded the automated DUnitX suite to 65 tests.
- Added regression coverage for:
  - asynchronous `ForceQueue` behavior;
  - custom-button `mrNone` rejection;
  - facade-level validation for manually constructed invalid custom buttons;
  - telemetry formatter escaping and single-line normalization;
  - await timeout behavior without callback invocation.

### Compatibility

- No public API signature changes.
- Existing examples and normal usage remain compatible.
- Existing code using valid custom buttons is unaffected.
- Code that attempted to use `mrNone` as a custom-button result now fails fast by design, because `mrNone` is reserved as the internal "no result" value.
